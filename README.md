# Dwani-Music_Recommendation_System
"Dhwani" is a Java music management app using Swing and JDBC. It offers secure login and features like adding users, songs, playlists, and viewing songs or concerts. With a MySQL database backend, it ensures efficient data management and a user-friendly GUI for seamless interaction and streamlined music organization. "Dhwani" is a comprehensive music management system developed in Java, leveraging Java Swing for its graphical user interface and JDBC for database connectivity. The application offers a seamless user experience with a modern, Spotify-inspired design that combines aesthetics and functionality. Upon launch, users are greeted with a secure login interface where credentials are validated against a MySQL database to ensure authorized access.

Once logged in, users are directed to the main dashboard, featuring a welcoming header and an array of well-designed buttons. Each button provides access to key functionalities, such as inserting new users, adding songs, creating playlists, and exploring existing songs or concert data. The intuitive layout makes navigation effortless, ensuring users can interact with the system without requiring technical expertise.

For data handling, the application utilizes prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and ensure secure database operations. Users can input details like song IDs, durations, and album or artist IDs when adding songs or playlists, with input validation steps to guide them in entering accurate information. The "Insert User" feature supports capturing essential user details, including a unique user ID, username, email, and password, all timestamped for record-keeping.

Additionally, the system provides data visualization through JTable components, allowing users to view structured tables of songs or concert details in a clear, scrollable format. This feature ensures that users can review stored information conveniently. The application's robust architecture ensures that each action is accompanied by error handling and informative prompts, making it highly reliable.

"Dhwani" is not just a tool for music data management but a showcase of how modern Java applications can provide a smooth, visually appealing, and secure user experience, blending rich functionality with a polished GUI. This project is ideal for learning about integrating database systems, enhancing user interfaces, and implementing real-world Java applications.
